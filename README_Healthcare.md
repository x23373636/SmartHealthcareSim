# Smart Healthcare Simulation using iFogSim2

This project simulates a **Fog-Driven Smart Healthcare System** to demonstrate how patient sensor data is processed across distributed fog clusters using load balancing and cloud support. Built with [iFogSim2](https://github.com/Cloudslab/iFogSim) and Eclipse IDE.

---

## üß¨ Features

- Patient monitoring with diverse sensors (e.g., Heart Rate, ECG, Glucose)
- Fog-based processing with energy-aware clusters
- Cluster-based architecture with **Equal Load Sharing (EQLS)** strategy
- Simulates:
  - Sensor data generation
  - Load balancing
  - Latency tracking
  - Fog/cloud processing and energy use

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites

- Java 8 or higher
- Eclipse IDE for Java Developers (2024-06 or newer)
- Git

### 2. Clone iFogSim Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cloudslab/iFogSim.git
```

> iFogSim2 is within the `iFogSim/iFogSim2/src` directory

### 3. Project Setup in Eclipse

1. Create a new Java project (e.g., `SmartHealthcareSim`)
2. Copy iFogSim2's `org` directory into your `src` folder
3. Add required JARs to the build path (`cloudsim-3.0.3.jar`, etc.)
4. Add the provided `SmartHealthcareSimulation.java` to the package:  
   `org.fog.test.perfeval`

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Simulation

1. Right-click `SmartHealthcareSimulation.java` ‚Üí `Run As` ‚Üí `Java Application`
2. Console output will display:
   - Simulation events
   - Cluster assignments
   - Latency and energy reports

## üìÅ Components Overview

| Component            | Description                                                     |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `PatientSensor`      | Represents a vital-monitoring sensor                            |
| `FogNode`            | Processes data at the edge, limited by load capacity            |
| `CloudStorage`       | Stores processed results                                        |
| `Cluster`            | A group of fog nodes with a victory score for routing           |
| `EQLSLoadBalancer`   | Selects optimal fog nodes based on load and cluster score       |
| `TaskScheduler`      | Schedules and sends sensor tasks to the load balancer           |

## üìä Simulated Metrics

- Data generated by each sensor (MB)
- Energy consumed per sensor and node (J)
- Average latency of task completion (s)
- Cloud storage usage (MB)
- Load per fog node

---

## üìå Notes

- `Victory Score` represents performance effectiveness of a cluster.
- EQLS favors higher-scoring clusters with less-loaded nodes.
- Simulated values use randomized logic for latency, energy, etc.
